## Academic Experience

### Research Towards Synthesis of Clionastatin B

(Undergraduate thesis) 

Sept. 2019 - May. 2021

Supervisor: Prof. Yandong Zhang, XMU. [Group Page](https://zhanglab.xmu.edu.cn/)

### Machine Learning Potential (MLP) of $\ce{TiO2}$ Water Interface Model and its Application

(Research assistant) 

Jul. 2021 - now

Supervisor: Prof. Jun Cheng, XMU. [Group Page](https://chengjun.xmu.edu.cn/)

- Trained MLP using `DeePMD` package; dataset exploration using `DPGEN` package.

- Obtained MLP gives DFT accuracy energy/force prediction for terraced  $\ce{TiO2}$ ($[1\overline{1}1]$ step) water interface model.

- Developed efficient python (multiprocessing) code to compute dissociation degree of $\ce{Ti_{CN5}}$ adsorbed water.

- Discovered that $\ce{Ti_{CN5}}$ adsorbed water are closer towards ?? $\ce{O_{br}}$ than ?? $\ce{O_{br}}$.
