## Academic Experience

### Machine Learning Potential (MLP) of $\ce{TiO2}$ Water Interface Model and its Application

(Research assistant) 

Jul. 2021 - now

Supervisor: Prof. Jun Cheng, XMU. [Group Page](https://chengjun.xmu.edu.cn/)

- Trained MLP using `DeePMD` package; dataset exploration using `DPGEN` package.
- Obtained MLP gives DFT accuracy energy/force prediction for terraced  $\ce{TiO2}$ ($[1\overline{1}1]$ step) water interface model.
- Developed an efficient python (multiprocessing) code to compute dissociation degree of $\ce{Ti_{CN5}}$ adsorbed water.
- Discovered that water molecules adsorbed above $\ce{Ti_{5c}}$ are closer towards of the of two rows of $\ce{O_{br}}$.
- Studied hydrogen accepting behavior of $\ce{O_{br}}$ of terraced $\ce{TiO2}$ surface.
