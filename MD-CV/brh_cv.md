## Academic Experience

### Study of thermodynamic stability of different surface hydroxyl terminations for SrFeO3-x

(Research assistant) 

Feb. 2022 - May. 2022

Supervisor: Prof. Jun Cheng, XMU. [Group Page](https://chengjun.xmu.edu.cn/)

- Electronic structure calculations and cell parameter optimization for bulk SrFeO3-x (x=0, 1/8, 2/8, 4/8) at PBE, PBE+U and MGGA-SCAN level.

- Formation energy of defects calculation.

### Machine Learning Potential (MLP) of $\ce{TiO2}$ Water Interface Model and its Application

(Research assistant) 

Jul. 2021 - Jun. 2022

Supervisor: Prof. Jun Cheng, XMU. [Group Page](https://chengjun.xmu.edu.cn/)

- Obtained MLP gives DFT accuracy energy/force prediction for TiO2 water interface models with \[1-11\] step defect. (`DeePMD-kit` and `DPGEN` sutie)

- Studied the effect of TiO2 step edge (\[1-11\]) on surface water behaviors. (Water dissociation and spatial distribution).

- Studied the well-known size effect in TiO2 simulations. Researched the effect of TiO2 size on surface water dissociation by running DPMD of TiO2 slabs with varied number of Ti-O tri-layers.

- Developed efficient MDAnalysis python codes:
  
  - Surface water dissociation degree from MD simulation;

  - Spatial distribution of surface water and oxygen bridge confirms the double row pattern of surface water found in EC-STM experiment.
